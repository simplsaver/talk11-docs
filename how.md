# How to use

Once you've set up Talk 11, using the plugin in a post means scrolling down to the meta box in the post editing screen and doing a couple of very simple things.

## Selecting a voice

While Talk 11's settings screen lets you set a default voice to be used, you can also change this in the voice selection dropdown on the post editor.

The size of dropdown will change based on the names of voices in your library, so the field goes off the page, it's because the names of the voices in your library are long.

## Credit estimation

To help you understand how much of a dent your request will have on your credit quota, we've provided an estimate based on the characters being sent.

Depending on the AI model being used and the price of the characters used at each, this estimation will very likely be wrong. It's more of a hint, but not necessarily a realistic expectation of quota loss.

## Generating the audio

When you're ready to generate your audio file, press the "Generate Audio" button to have the text of your content sent to Eleven Labs. This will generate the file and once completed, save it to your Wordpress uploads folder.

Make sure you save your post **before** you hit the generate audio button. Once an audio file has been completed and downloaded, it will reload the post edit screen to show the audio file for playback. That means you ideally want to save the text of an article _before_ generating the audio, otherwise the page will try to leave and refresh.

## Clearing the audio and regenerating

If the file doesn't come out quite the way you want -- it's AI audio, after all, and prone to interpretations -- you can clear the audio and regenerate it, using the obvious buttons in the panel.

Regenerating audio at Eleven Labs can typically be done without excess credit loss, provided the content hasn't changed and the first generation was made less than two hours ago. See Eleven Labs for more [information on regeneration rules](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/product/troubleshooting/regenerations).
